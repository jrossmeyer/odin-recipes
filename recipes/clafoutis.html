    <h2>Dan Gritzer's Cherry Clafoutis</h2>
    <p class="description">This is a recipe you make if you've never made dessert but want to your friends to think you have.</p>

    <h3 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour (about 2 1/2 ounces or 75g)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons granulated sugar (about 1 1/4 ounces or 40g)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon (kosher) salt </li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk </li>
        <li>2 large eggs, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted, plus more for greasing</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon kirsch (optional)</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon pure vanilla extract or 1 vanilla bean, split and seeds scraped</li>
        <li>3/4 pound sweet cherries, pitted (see notes)</li>
        <li>Powdered sugar, for serving</li>
        <li>Whipped cream, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="instructions">Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).In a medium mixing bowl, stir together flour, sugar, and salt.
        Whisk in milk, eggs, butter, kirsch (if using), and vanilla extract or seeds until a smooth batter forms.
    </ol>
    <ol>Grease a baking dish, tart pan, or cast iron skillet (about 9 inches in diameter) with butter.
        Scatter cherries all over bottom. Pour batter on top and bake until clafoutis is puffed and browned and a knife inserted in center comes out clean, about 50 minutes.
        Let cool slightly, then slice and serve, sprinkling powdered sugar on top. Serve with whipped cream, if desired.
    </ol>
    <h5>Notes:</h5>
     <p class="note">If using a vanilla bean, reserve the scraped bean for another use (you can stick it in a container of sugar to create vanilla sugar, for instance).</p>
     <p class="note">We like pitted cherries because the clafoutis is easier to eat that way, but feel free to leave the cherries whole if you prefer;
        that's a more traditional way to do it, and some people like the subtle bitter almond flavor the pits add to the dessert.
